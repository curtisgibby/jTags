You'll find that jTags has recieved a bit of a visually appealing facelift with its new site Redesign by [ABaker86](http://abaker86.github.io/WebPortfolio/ "Adam Baker Software Developer").

Just as jTags is intending to cut the clutter, the new redesign is intended to help developers get to the jTag resources they need with minimal effort. Immediate downoload and documentation links are located at the top of the home page. Other pages have a natural navigation at the top and bottom of each page.
