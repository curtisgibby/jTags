standard jTags
--------------

The standard jTags are the jTags that come pre-built with the core library. they are ment to provide an easy way to create a web application that runs mostly on the client instead of the server thus making the website musch more efficient , faster and much more dynamic. 

the jTags standard tags are built with the moto :
***"the server is ment to provide data not junk !"***

with junk referring to the repetitive behaviour of servers nowadays.
the server sould *not* provide identical information twice , and should provide the data only when necessary.
