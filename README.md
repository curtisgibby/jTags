About jTags
===========

jTags are a unique way of building a highly dynamic, customizable and efficient website quickly and easily.

With jTags you can embed functionality to html tags to make them perform a certain task. 

```html
<repeater times="5">
	<p>this will be repeated 5 times.</p>
<repeater>
```

turns into this:
```html
<p>this will be repeated 5 times.</p>
<p>this will be repeated 5 times.</p>
<p>this will be repeated 5 times.</p>
<p>this will be repeated 5 times.</p>
<p>this will be repeated 5 times.</p>
```
